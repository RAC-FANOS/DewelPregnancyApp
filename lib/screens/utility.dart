  During pregnancy, you’re eating habits affect your baby.
  Your baby depends on good nutrition for growth & development.
  Making healthy food choices and having a balanced diet during pregnancy will help prepare your baby for lifelong health!''',
        value: 'Healthy mom, healthy baby'),
    DuringList(content: '''   
  Your body goes through numerous physical and hormonal changes during pregnancy. The way you nourish your body during this time will affect your health and your baby’s. You must eat a healthful, balanced diet to help ensure you stay healthy throughout your pregnancy. The food you eat is your baby’s main source of nourishment, so it’s critical to consume foods that are rich in nutrients. Proper nutrition can help promote your baby’s growth and development.
            
  By following some fairly easy nutrition guidelines, you can be on your way to a healthy pregnancy.
            

    Increased Nutrients
        
  Your body has increased nutritional needs during pregnancy. Although the old adage saying “double your food intake” isn’t entirely correct, you do require more micro-nutrients and macro-nutrients to support you and your baby.
        
  Micro-nutrients are dietary components, such as vitamins and minerals, that are only required in small amounts. Macro-nutrients are nutrients that provide calories, or energy. These include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. 
            
  To ensure you’re getting all the necessary nutrients eat different foods every day from each of the food groups listed below. In fact, all meals should include at least three different food groups.\n  
            
    What and how much to eat'
            
  
  Your body can’t function properly if it’s missing the nutrients from any of these food groups. Remember that your goal is to eat a wide variety of foods during pregnancy. Whenever possible, choose natural, low-fat foods over processed junk foods. Chips and soda, for example, contain no nutritional value. You and your baby will benefit more from fresh fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, such as chicken, fish, beans, or lentils.
            
  This does not necessarily mean that you need to avoid all of your favorite foods during pregnancy. However, you must balance them with nutritious foods so that you don’t miss any important vitamins or minerals.
            
    Should I still take a prenatal vitamin if I eat these foods?
            
  Even if you eat a balanced diet, you can still miss out on essential nutrients. A prenatal vitamin, ideally started 3 months before you get pregnant, is recommended to make sure you get all the nutrients needed for a healthy pregnancy. It is also recommended women take prenatal vitamins while breastfeeding.
            
    The Don’ts of pregnancy Nutrition
        
       • Don’t Overdo fish: No more than 170 grams per week
       • Don’t Consume ALCOHOL or TOBACCO

       • A missed period: The most common and clear-cut sign of pregnancy is a missed period. However, missing your period isn’t always a sign of pregnancy. You can also miss your period from stress, excessive exercise, dieting, hormone imbalances and other factors that might cause irregular periods.  
       • Frequent trips to the bathroom: Before you even miss a period, you may notice that you have to urinate more often. 
       • Fatigue (feeling tired)': Many women feel extremely tired in early pregnancy. The fatigue tends to get better in the second trimester. However, it does come back in the third trimester for many women.  
       • Morning sickness: Despite the name, this pregnancy symptom can happen at any time of the day or night. Nausea can happen as early as two weeks into a pregnancy or it can start a few months after conception. Not everyone experiences nausea and there are various levels of nausea. You can have nausea without vomiting—this changes from woman to woman. Though nausea during pregnancy is fairly normal, it can be a problem if you become dehydrated. Women who cannot keep down food and fluids because of extreme nausea could have a condition called hyperemesis gravidarum. Contact your healthcare provider if you are experiencing extreme nausea and dehydration.  
       • Sore (and enlarging) breasts: Your breasts can become tender to the touch during pregnancy. The soreness may be similar to the way breasts feel before a period, only more so. Your nipples might also begin to darken and enlarge. This soreness is temporary and fades once your body gets used to the increased hormones.

  Making healthy food choices and having a balanced diet during pregnancy will help prepare your baby for lifelong health!'''

    //Getting the nutrients contains a table and bullet point lists
    [
      '''   
  Your body goes through numerous physical and hormonal changes during pregnancy. The way you nourish your body during this time will affect your health and your baby’s. You must eat a healthful, balanced diet to help ensure you stay healthy throughout your pregnancy. The food you eat is your baby’s main source of nourishment, so it’s critical to consume foods that are rich in nutrients. Proper nutrition can help promote your baby’s growth and development.
            
  By following some fairly easy nutrition guidelines, you can be on your way to a healthy pregnancy.
            

    Increased Nutrients
        
  Your body has increased nutritional needs during pregnancy. Although the old adage saying “double your food intake” isn’t entirely correct, you do require more micro-nutrients and macro-nutrients to support you and your baby.
        
  Micro-nutrients are dietary components, such as vitamins and minerals, that are only required in small amounts. Macro-nutrients are nutrients that provide calories, or energy. These include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. 
            
  To ensure you’re getting all the necessary nutrients eat different foods every day from each of the food groups listed below. In fact, all meals should include at least three different food groups.\n''',

//still getting nutrients

      '''
            
    What and how much to eat'
            
  
  Your body can’t function properly if it’s missing the nutrients from any of these food groups. Remember that your goal is to eat a wide variety of foods during pregnancy. Whenever possible, choose natural, low-fat foods over processed junk foods. Chips and soda, for example, contain no nutritional value. You and your baby will benefit more from fresh fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, such as chicken, fish, beans, or lentils.
            
  This does not necessarily mean that you need to avoid all of your favorite foods during pregnancy. However, you must balance them with nutritious foods so that you don’t miss any important vitamins or minerals.
            
    Should I still take a prenatal vitamin if I eat these foods?
            
  Even if you eat a balanced diet, you can still miss out on essential nutrients. A prenatal vitamin, ideally started 3 months before you get pregnant, is recommended to make sure you get all the nutrients needed for a healthy pregnancy. It is also recommended women take prenatal vitamins while breastfeeding.

  Weight gain during pregnancy is important for the development and growth of your baby.  
             
  Weight gain for normal BMI (18.5-24.9) is between 0 kg - 1.8 kg during the first 12 week of pregnancy. And 0.45 kg per week after 12th week of pregnancy.
             
  Remember pregnancy is not the right time to diet or lose weight as it could prevent your baby from getting essential nutrients.

    [
      '''   
  Common early pregnancy symptoms can include:  
      
       • A missed period: The most common and clear-cut sign of pregnancy is a missed period. However, missing your period isn’t always a sign of pregnancy. You can also miss your period from stress, excessive exercise, dieting, hormone imbalances and other factors that might cause irregular periods.  
       • Frequent trips to the bathroom: Before you even miss a period, you may notice that you have to urinate more often. 
       • Fatigue (feeling tired)': Many women feel extremely tired in early pregnancy. The fatigue tends to get better in the second trimester. However, it does come back in the third trimester for many women.  
       • Morning sickness: Despite the name, this pregnancy symptom can happen at any time of the day or night. Nausea can happen as early as two weeks into a pregnancy or it can start a few months after conception. Not everyone experiences nausea and there are various levels of nausea. You can have nausea without vomiting—this changes from woman to woman. Though nausea during pregnancy is fairly normal, it can be a problem if you become dehydrated. Women who cannot keep down food and fluids because of extreme nausea could have a condition called hyperemesis gravidarum. Contact your healthcare provider if you are experiencing extreme nausea and dehydration.  
       • Sore (and enlarging) breasts: Your breasts can become tender to the touch during pregnancy. The soreness may be similar to the way breasts feel before a period, only more so. Your nipples might also begin to darken and enlarge. This soreness is temporary and fades once your body gets used to the increased hormones. You may also notice that your breasts have enlarged and your bra is tighter than normal.'''
